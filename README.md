Game of Life
by Naim Lujan


This is my implementation of Game of Life.


The initial board is blank and the user has the option of clicking on the random button to create a random board or the glider button which 
creates the Gosper glider gun. 

The user can also create a custom game by clicking every cell he/she wishes to be filled in or not.
The user can then press play to start the game of life or press the stop button at any time to stop it. The
user is also able to clear the board. The user can modify the speed at which the game is running as well.
